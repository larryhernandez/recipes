INGREDIENTS
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter
3/4 cups white sugar
3/4 brown sugar
2 eggs
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 cups oatmeal
1 teaspoon hot water
1 cup raisins
2 teaspoon vanilla extract


DIRECTIONS
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a cookie sheet.

First, add the butter and sugars into a mixing bowl and cream with mixer. 
Add the eggs and mix well. With a large spoon mix in the flour, salt, 
cinnamon, baking soda, and the oatmeal, mix well.

Add the water, raisins, and vanilla. Flour a workspace and with a rolling 
pin or your hands make a "snake" with the dough and cut it into several 
pieces or in a pretzel shape. Place on the prepared cookie sheet.

Bake for 10 to 15 minutes (depending on how thick you snakes are). Let them 
sit and cool on the stove.
